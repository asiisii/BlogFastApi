# The following arguments are supported:

# allow_origins - A list of origins that should be permitted to make cross-origin requests. E.g. ['https://example.org', 'https://www.example.org']. You can use ['*'] to allow any origin.
# allow_origin_regex - A regex string to match against origins that should be permitted to make cross-origin requests. e.g. 'https://.*\.example\.org'.
# allow_methods - A list of HTTP methods that should be allowed for cross-origin requests. Defaults to ['GET']. You can use ['*'] to allow all standard methods.
# allow_headers - A list of HTTP request headers that should be supported for cross-origin requests. Defaults to []. You can use ['*'] to allow all headers. The Accept, Accept-Language, Content-Language and Content-Type headers are always allowed for simple CORS requests.
# allow_credentials - Indicate that cookies should be supported for cross-origin requests. Defaults to False. Also, allow_origins cannot be set to ['*'] for credentials to be allowed, origins must be specified.
# expose_headers - Indicate any response headers that should be made accessible to the browser. Defaults to [].
# max_age - Sets a maximum time in seconds for browsers to cache CORS responses. Defaults to 600.
